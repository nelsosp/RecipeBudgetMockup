# Grocery Web Scraper and Recipe Budget App
This project aimed to create a comprehensive tool to help users manage their grocery budgets by combining real-time data from grocery stores with recipes and their respective ingredients. The project however evolved into two parts: the initial web scraping initiative and a later usage of an API, which led to the creation of a separate project named Budget Bites leaving this project to end early. But here was the progress made:

## Step 1: Grocery Store Data Collection:
- Developed a Python script to scrape variety of pages in a grocery store website's api.
- Implemented data cleaning to gather specific information on grocery items, including name, and price.

## Step 2: Recipe and Ingredient Data Collection:
- Created another Python script to scrape recipe website(s).
- Implemented data cleaning to gather specific information of recipe details such as title, description, ingredients, and instructions, pictures.

## Step 3: Data Integration and Processing:
- Mapped ingredients from recipes to the grocery store items collected in the previous step but this is where problems began to arise.
- Hoped to implement algorithms to match ingredients from recipes with corresponding grocery items and combine this data into a database but ended before this point.

# Grocery Web Scraper and Recipe Budget App
This project aimed to create a comprehensive tool to help users manage their grocery budgets by combining real-time data from grocery stores with recipes and their respective ingredients. The project however evolved into two parts: the initial web scraping initiative and a later usage of an API, which led to the creation of a separate project named Budget Bites leaving this project to end early. But here was the progress made:

#### Grocery Store Data Collection:
Developed a Python script to scrape variety of pages in a grocery store website's api.
Implemented data cleaning to gather specific information on grocery items, including name, and price.

#### Recipe and Ingredient Data Collection:
Created another Python script to scrape recipe website(s).
Implemented data cleaning to gather specific information of recipe details such as title, description, ingredients, and instructions, pictures.

#### Data Integration and Processing:
Mapped ingredients from recipes to the grocery store items collected in the previous step but this is where problems began to arise.
Hoped to implement algorithms to match ingredients from recipes with corresponding grocery items and combine this data into a database.
